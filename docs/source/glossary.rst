""""""""""""""""""""

The workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine 
Learning service, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning service. The workspace keeps a history of all training runs, including logs, metrics, output, and a snapshot of your scripts. 
You use this information to determine which training run produces the best model.

.. _ServicePrincipal:

Service principal
"""""""""""""""""""
To access resources that are secured by an Azure AD tenant, the entity that requires access must be represented by a security principal. This is true for both users (user principal) and applications (service principal).

The security principal defines the access policy and permissions for the user/application in the Azure AD (Azure Aztive Directory) tenant. 
This enables core features such as authentication of the user/application during sign-in, and authorization during resource access.
